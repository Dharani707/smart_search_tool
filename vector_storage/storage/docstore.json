Why is sentiment analysis so popular in data science? And how can you perform sentiment analysis? Find the answers to all these questions in this free course on Sentiment Analysis using Python! \n\nWhat is Sentiment Analysis?\n\nSentiment Analysis or Opinion Mining is a technique used to analyse the emotion in a text. We can extract the attitude or the opinion of a piece of text and get insights on it.\u00a0\nIn the context of machine learning, you can think of Sentiment Analysis as a Classification problem where the text can either have a positive sentiment, a negative sentiment or a neutral one.\n\n\nWhat are the applications of Sentiment Analysis in the industry?\n\nIn the age of social media, it is extremely common to comment about\u00a0\na movie you liked or\u00a0\na book you didn\u2019t like or\u00a0\na product you bought was not up to the mark.\n\n\nTherefore, a lot of companies use sentiment analysis for their products since it provides direct feedback of the customer\u2019s opinion.\nIt is also important to detect and remove hateful content from social media and companies like Twitter, Facebook, etc. extensively use sentiment analysis on a daily basis.\n\n\u00a0\nOn what kind of projects would I implement sentiment analysis?\nThere are a wide variety of projects where you can use Sentiment Analysis. Here are a couple of popular use cases:\n\nSentiment Analysis can not only be used for customer reviews or product feedback, but in other domains as well.\nAnalyzing the sentiments on social media on the US Elections, for example, gives useful insights on which candidates are favoured by the public and which are not.\n\nFor other interesting problems involving sentiment/emotion detection, you can visit: https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/all/\n\nWhat is the range of sentiments that can be observed and analysed?\n\nIn the earlier days of\u00a0Natural language processing\u00a0and Sentiment Analysis, the sentiments could hold only 2 or 3 values: Positive or Negative, and Positive, Neutral or Negative.\nHowever, with the advent of deep learning, we can now recognize the subtle emotions in a text as well.\nThis has made tasks like Sarcasm detection, fake news detection etc. popular in research areas of Natural language processing\u00a0\n\n\nCan I add this project to my resume and use it in my Interview?\n\nSentiment Analysis is one of the most popular applications of Machine Learning and Classification in Natural language processing\nWe also encourage you to take up more diverse datasets and apply sentiment analysis on them.\nSentiment Analysis is also one of the first projects you would learn in your Natural language processing journey and as such is commonly asked in interviews.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2677, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "67834ed0-5f52-4427-8c7b-3c3489228396": {"__data__": {"id_": "67834ed0-5f52-4427-8c7b-3c3489228396", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Pandas for Data Analysis in Python", "link": "https://courses.analyticsvidhya.com/courses/pandas-for-data-analysis-in-python"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bb5ccbef-aa43-4242-b62a-f363919f5b99", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"title": "Pandas for Data Analysis in Python", "link": "https://courses.analyticsvidhya.com/courses/pandas-for-data-analysis-in-python"}, "hash": "e6963c79d0bd94c38d949e4f97e6827989b62ee474a30bd92ecc1f95f39b3d0b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "What is Pandas?

There is an unprecedented volume of data on the internet right now - and data science projects often need this data to build predictive models.\nThat\u2019s a key reason why data scientists are expected to be familiar with web scraping.\nWe have found web scraping to be a very helpful technique for gathering data from multiple websites. Some websites these days also provide APIs for many different types of data you might want to use, such as Tweets or LinkedIn posts.\nBut there might be occasions when you need to collect data from a website that does not provide a specific API. This is where having the ability to perform web scraping comes in handy. As a data scientist, you can code a simple Python script and extract the data you\u2019re looking for.\nSo knowing how to perform web scraping using Python will help you go a long way towards becoming a resourceful data scientist.
